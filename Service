Service is connect with and to your pod.

It is the way to expose an app running on a set of pods as a network service (similar to load balancer)
if we want to expose our pod , the app running in the pod as a network service like we want to host nginx or tomcat or even the backend ,
we need to use service with our pod the service is similar to load balancer like what load balancer does ELB in AWS ,same service will be doing for the pod
so for the starters,in really not so difficult to understand just like a load balancer and you want to expose your pod communicating with each other ,
we need service in front of our pod.

WHY SERVICE IS CREATED ? WHY NOT JUST SIMPLE PORT MAPPING?
