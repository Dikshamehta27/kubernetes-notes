Pod : A pod is the basic execution unit of a k8s application-the smallest and simplest unit in the k8s object model that we create or deploy.
A pod represents processes running on your cluster.

pods that run a single container:
the "one container per pod" model is the most common use case in k8s
pod as a wrapper around  a single container .
k8s manages the pods rather than container directly.

Multi container Pod:
Tightly coupled and need to share the resources.
one main container and other as a sidecar or init container.
each pod is meant to run a single instance of a given app 
should use multiple pods to scale horizontly
